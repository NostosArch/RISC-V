# RISC-V
## 5-Stage Pipelined RISCV-32I Processor

- Developed a pipelined RISCV-32I processor having Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Write-Back stages with
hazard detection and forwarding units using Verilog on Xilinx Vivado.

- Performed sanity checks on each designed module using custom testbenches written in Verilog.
